# clean-pc
i reccomend using the clean pc V3.exe, you can find it in the EXE folder inside the V3.X folder.
i really discurrage you using the V1 its really bad. like really really bad

dont mind the "clean pc v3 - copy" in the V3.X folder, i just use that so i have to code for all the versions. i later rename it to 3.1 or something idk

an annoying thing in the V2.X is the message boxes, it creates a message box every time it deletes files in a directory so yea uhm... please use the v3 its overall just better
(the message boxes sounded like a good idea but they really arent)

i am NOT to be held responsable for any valuble files that are lost
