# clean-pc
i reccomend using the clean pc V3.exe, you can find it in the EXE folder inside the V3.X folder
and i really discurrage you using the V1 its really bad. like really really bad

dont mind the "clean pc v3 - copy" in the V3.X folder, i just use that so i have to code for all the versions. i later rename it to 3.1 or something idk
